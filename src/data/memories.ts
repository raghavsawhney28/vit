    story: "The moment I saw you standing on that quiet street, time stopped. Your smile lit up the entire world around me. When we hugged for the first time — just the two of us, outside the house, with no one else — I knew in my heart that these five days would change everything. The butterflies in my stomach weren’t just fluttering... they were soaring, lifting me off the ground, reminding me that this was real — that you were finally here.",

    subtitle: "A date where the movie didn’t matter",
    story: "We slipped into the theatre, but our eyes never met the screen. It was your laughter, your touch, and the way our hearts raced that stole the spotlight. In the dim light between scenes, every kiss felt like a secret — every stolen glance, a spark. That day wasn’t about the film… it was about falling deeper into us. After the movie at PVR, we went to Hundred Heritage for lunch date, where we had the most delicious cheese balls ever. I still remember how happy and cute you looked while enjoying them. That moment felt so perfect. 💫🧀",

    subtitle: "Cuddles, coffee, and cozy moments",
    story: "The day, we spent four magical hours together at Park Inn Hotel — hours that felt like minutes in the warmth of our love. We laughed while making coffee side by side, stole glances and kisses, and in between all the giggles and romance, we found moments of quiet — like when we fell asleep in each other's arms for just five minutes, but it felt like home I kissed her forehead gently as she smiled with her eyes closed, and the love we shared in that room will stay with me forever. Her happiness, her laughter, and the way she melted into every kiss — especially the ones I left softly on her neck — are moments etched in my heart forever. 💜☕🛏️.",

After that, we visited the pancake shop and shared a delicious stack of pancakes. We hugged each other tightly — time felt like it paused for a moment. Then came the hardest part… saying goodbye. Both of us were emotional, holding back tears as we parted, our hearts heavy but full of love.",
